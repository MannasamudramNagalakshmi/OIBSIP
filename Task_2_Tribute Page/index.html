                   <p>Nicola Tesla was born in Smiljan on July 10,1859.
                    During his birth, lightning struck during a summer storm.Due to this
                    Tesla was nicknamed "Child of the Storm" and "Child of light".

                <p>Tesla began to study engineering at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria.
                     He claimed to have graduated, but the institution disagrees.

                 field principle. This is used today in alternators.

                <p>Tesla moved to the United States in 1884, immediately approaching Thomas Edison with a letter of introduction. According to Tesla,
                     he was offered 50,000 dollars to solve a problem, but Edison never paid.

               <h1>Nikola Tesla</h1>
               <p>Nikola Tesla (born July 10, 1856) was an inventor and a skilled electrical
                    engineer, mechanical engineer and physicist. During the early days of electricity, 
                    Tesla worked specifically on alternating current, or AC power. While he did not win the electrical race, 
                    he was a highly influential voice in the search for electricity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
